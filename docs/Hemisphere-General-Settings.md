# General Settings

The first full-screen page in the [config menu](Hemisphere-Config) (after the floating [presets menu](Hemisphere-Presets)) is a collection of various options.

![General Settings](images/General-Settings.png)

### Trigger Length
This sets the pulse width (in milliseconds, approximate) for applets that generate simple triggers, such as **EuclidX** or **TrigSeq**. The old default was close to 3ms, but some modules may require longer pulses.

***

### Screensaver
Some are decorative, and some are informative. Options are:
* [blank]
* Meters - useful for visualizing all inputs/outputs
* Zaps (or Snow!)
* Scope - visualizes outputs
* Zips
* Stars
* Beats - clock beat/measure counter

***

### Cursor Wrap
As of v1.7, the cursor behavior from Hemisphere/Benisphere Suite (press encoder to step to next parameter, rotate to edit) has been removed, and been replaced by a **modal** cursor:
* rotate encoder to move cursor
* push to toggle editing mode
* rotate to edit parameter
* push again to untoggle editing mode

This config option determines whether the cursor loops around or stops:
* **on** will allow infinite looping scrolling: the cursor will wrap from the last parameter to the first, and vice versa.
* **off** will prevent looped scrolling, terminating at the beginning and end of the parameter list.

_Note: Some applets (eg. Button2) may not conform to the modal cursor behaviour. Simple on/off toggle options can typically be switched with just a button push, no edit mode._

***

### Preset Bank# (Quadrants only)
The currently loaded bank can be switched here in addition to the [Presets](Hemisphere-Presets) picker menu.

### Preset Jump Trigger
_(New in v1.12!)_
This is a configurable Trigger Input mapping, with multiplier/divider, used to simply load the next preset in sequence. Just like any other [Input Mapping](Hemisphere-Input-Mapping), it can be assigned to any of the physical input jacks, applet outputs A, B, C, etc., MIDI Maps, or internal Clock. It is triggered when the selected input goes high (above a certain threshold, typically 1.5V). If the Clock is running, the preset load action synchronizes to the next Beat.

### MIDI-PC Channel
Preset changes can also be triggered with MIDI Program Change messages. This setting allows you to filter this to a specific MIDI Channel, or "Omni" for all channels, or "Off" to disable.

### Auto MIDI Output
(Experimental) When enabled, MIDI messages are sent automatically based on applet outputs. By default, the Left Hemisphere outputs on Channel 1, and the Right Hemisphere on Channel 2 (configurable with the [MIDI Out](MIDI-Out) applet). Outputs A/C are interpreted as Note values, and B/D as gates for NoteOn/NoteOff.

### MIDI Thru
By default, all MIDI traffic is passed thru from all interfaces to all other interfaces. This can be disabled here to avoid excessive processing, unwanted clock loops, etc.
